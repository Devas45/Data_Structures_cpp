PASS BY REFERENCE

*The call/pass by ref method of passing arg to a func copies the 
 ref of an arg into the formal parameter.

*Inside the func,the ref is used to accesss the actual arg used in the call.
 Changes made to the parameter affect the passed argument(Effects).

*To pass the value by ref,arg ref is passed just like another value.

void passbyref(int &x,int &y)
{
 int z=x;
 x=y;
 y=z;
}


PASS BY POINTER/CALL BY ADDRESS

*The call by pointer method of passing arg to a func. copies the address of
 arg into the formal parameter.

*Inside the func,the address is used to access the actual argument used in
the call. (Effects)

*0 To pass the value of pointer arg pointers are passed to func just like value.

void passByReference(int *x,int *y)
{
   int z=*x;
   *x=*y;
   *y=z;
}
call(&x);
